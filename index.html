  <h1>Bridging Factions: A Meet-up Connecting Diverse Perspectives in Human–Computer Interaction</h1>

  <div class="info">
    <strong>Format:</strong> Meetup<br>
    <strong>Conference:</strong> ACM CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2026<br>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Barcelona at the Centre de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona<br>
    <strong>Dates:</strong> 13–17 April, 2026<br>
    <strong>Session Date/Time/Room:</strong> To Be Confirmed (TBC)
  </div>

  <h2>Event Description</h2>
  <p>
    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) flourishes through methodological diversity, encompassing computational, human-centric, theoretical, and integrative traditions. While this richness strengthens the field, it can also foster silos and misunderstandings. Computational work may be perceived as rigid, human-centric approaches as less rigorous, theoretical perspectives as abstract, and integrators as “jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Bridging Factions</strong> provides a friendly and inclusive environment for CHI attendees to acknowledge, explore, and connect across these divides. Through activities such as a post-it notes interests wall and speed networking, participants will identify shared interests, discover unexpected overlaps, and establish new connections across HCI “factions.” The session welcomes researchers, students, educators, and industry professionals—no prior expertise is necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the conclusion of the meet-up, attendees will have expanded their networks, gained shared insights into cross-faction collaboration, and developed a stronger appreciation for how diverse approaches in HCI can complement one another.
  </p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The Bridging Factions meet-up aims to encourage mutually beneficial cross-factional engagement within the HCI community. It will create a welcoming and informal atmosphere to support participants to recognise their factions, understand others’, and identify collaboration opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that the speed networking activity will help attendees expand their professional networks and appreciate the complementary strengths of diverse HCI areas.
  </p>
